# CSS iTunes Albums
**A little demo showing the iTunes album art interface in pure CSS3 and HTML!**

This demo shows iTunes 12 style album art buttons, where you click on the album and it 'floats' up, and album info appears below it.

Cba to pick one. But itâ€™s free - free I say! Use it as you will.  A little kudos goes a long way though ;)
